      <center><h1>Food Tips</h1>
      <p>Your baby gains weight quickly during the third trimester, and parts of their body continue to form. Eyes open, nails form, and hair grows, to name just a few of the things that go on.

        With all this stuff happening, the food choices you make are very important for the health of your baby.</p>
       
        <h2>Vitamin A</h2>
        <p>It helps your baby’s bones grow. It also supports their skin and vision. Your baby’s eyes open and start to detect light in the third trimester.</p>
        <h2>Vitamin C</h2>
        <p>It helps your body take in iron. It also helps make your baby's teeth, gums, and bones healthy. Your immune system needs it, too.</p>
        <h2>Vitam B6</h2>
        <p>It is an important nutrient for the development of red blood cells and your baby’s brain.</p>
        <h2>Vitamin D</h2>
        <p>It helps you and your baby take in calcium. That helps strengthen the bones and teeth of both you and your baby.</p></center>
      <center><h1>Best foods for the Third trimester(6 Month)</h1><br>  
      </p><br>
        <h2>Broccoli</h2>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="b.jpeg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p> It is safe to eat broccoli in moderate amounts during pregnancy (1). Broccoli is rich in vitamins A, C, K, B6, calcium, folatei, fiber, and antioxidant agents. Including this nutrient-rich food in your diet ensures good hemoglobin supply, strengthens bones, prevents skin ailments, birth defectsi, and boosts nutrient intake.
      </p><br>
        <h2>Cornmeal</h2>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="cm.jpeg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p>Corn packs in folic acid which is important for the prevention of defects in the baby.
            Since corn is a rich source of dietary fiber, it will help balance the digestive system and keep constipation at bay.
            Since corn has thiamine, it can help promote the development of the baby’s brain.
            Eating corn can also help improve the baby’s eye health as it has lots of antioxidants.
            Corn has lots of phenolic compounds and antioxidants which can help keep cancer at bay.
            Since sweet corn is rich in vitamins B1 and B5, it has numerous health benefits for the health of the skin and hair.
            Corn is a great source of beta-carotene which can boost immunity. </p>
       
       
        
        <h2>Cod</h2>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="c.jpeg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p>
            Cod is a very popular fish, so when you’re pregnant you want to make sure that it’s safe to eat, as some types of fish are high in mercury.
            
            Cod is one of the safest types of fish to eat during pregnancy because it is fairly low in mercury. However, different species of cod have different considerations, and you should ensure cod is cooked and prepared properly to make sure it’s safe.
            
            Fish is an excellent source of protein as it is low in fat, and also provides Omega-3s which are important for pregnancy.
            
            
      </p><br>
        <h2>Barley</h2>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="ba.jpeg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p>Barley is one of the oldest cereal grains consumed around the globe in the form of bread, stews, malt, or soups. It is safe to consume barley during pregnancy in moderation. Anecdotal evidence suggests the use of barley water to reduce common pregnancy symptoms. However, excess consumption may make you sick, and in some women, it may also trigger gluten intolerance. Women with known gluten allergies and celiac disease should avoid barley and try gluten-free grains.
