      <center><h2>Benefits Of Yoga In Third Trimester(8 Month)</h2></center><br>
      <center><p>Practicing yoga during pregnancy is a great way to nurture you and your baby. It can also help you cope and prepare both your mind and body for any pregnancy demands and challenges that you may face especially during the third trimester.

        Yoga during pregnancy helps you to create space for both your baby and your internal organs. However, make sure that you only do what feels right and works, avoid muscle strains and extreme pressure exercises.
        
        There are plenty of yoga techniques that can help you to prepare for labor in the 3rd trimester. Before you try out yoga, make sure you talk to your doctor. This way, you may know the do and don’t during this stage. The following are some of the common yoga exercises to try out during the third trimester.</p></center>
      <br>
      <center><h1>Exercises</h1></center>
      <center><h2>1. Rotation of Shoulders</h2>
        <br>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="1082607659-H.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p>The movement stimulates the muscles present in the shoulder and the upper back, improving blood circulation. The flexibility of shoulder muscles increases as well, which reduces stiffness in the neck. The double arm exercise also helps stimulate the mammary glands of the mother.</p>
        <br>
     
        <h2>2. Cranking the Ankle</h2><br>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="1116470996-H.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p>Start with the right leg. Bend it and place it on the left knee, such that the foot is hanging on the other side. Hold the toes with your left hand and the base of the ankle with your right hand. Now, gently turn the ankle around in as many degrees of rotation as possible, while holding the toes. Rotate it clockwise for ten times and reverse the direction, rotating it for another ten. Repeat the same for the other foot, too.It increases blood circulation in the feet as well as brings relief to women suffering from edema or cramping, too.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3.Abdominal Stretch while Sleeping</h2><br>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="425010076-H.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p>Lie down and interlock fingers of both hands behind your head, allowing it to rest on them. Bend your knees so that the soles are flat on the ground. Now, turn your head to the left side and bend the legs from your hip to the right. This will cause your spine to stretch. Stay in this position for a few seconds and then return back. Switch by turning your head to the right and the legs to the left.Any complaints of constipation and indigestion can start getting alleviated by it. The spinal column gets a good exercise allowing you to sit for longer.</p>
        <br>
        <center><h2>4.Lying Down on One Side</h2>
            <br>
            <img style="height: 200px;"src="310822934-H.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
            <p>Lie down on the mat on your left side, with your arm stretched upwards acting as a pillow. Place a pillow between your legs and rest your right knee and shin on it while bending it. Let your right arm rest on your tummy for support. Relax in this position for at least 5-8 minutes.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>5. Low Lunge</h2>
                <br>
                <img style="height: 200px;"src="1064585681-H.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
                <p>Rest on your palms and gradually bring your right foot forward step by step, while keeping the left leg where it is. Once that is stretched, place your hands on a slightly raised stool if needed and thrust your chest forward while inhaling. Repeat for a few breaths and then switch the legs.The stretching helps increase the flexibility of the muscles, easing the delivery process and helping with recovery.</p>
