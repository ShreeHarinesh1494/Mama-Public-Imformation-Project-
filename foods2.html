      <center><h1>Foods eating tips</h1><br>
      <h3>1.Stay hydrated</h3><br>
      <p>Fill up a glass with water and place it on your nightstand before bed, then wake up and drink it before starting your day. If plain water doesn’t sound appetizing, add a slice of lemon, cucumber or fresh berries.</p><br>
      <h3>2.Snack well</h3><br>
      <p>A common symptom early in pregnancy is the quick onset of hunger with a simultaneous feeling of nausea and even fullness. Keep your blood sugar steady throughout the day by eating healthy snacks, such as a small handful of nuts, a few whole grain crackers with cheese, a piece of fresh fruit or a slice of whole grain toast with nut butter.</p><br>
      <h3>3.Pop that prenatal</h3><br>
      <p>No one eats perfectly every single day, which is one reason why taking your prenatal vitamin is so important. Set an alarm on your phone as a reminder to take your vitamin each day.</p><br>
      <h3>Best foods for the first trimester(2 Month)</h3><br>
      <h2> Dairy products</h2>
      <img style="height: 200px;"src="milk.jpeg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
      <p>During pregnancy, the consumption of dairy products is very important. It helps you meet the extra requirement of proteins and calcium which gives support to your growing fetus. Drink at least one glass of milk a day and consume more greek yoghurt, paneer and ghee to keep your baby healthy.
    </p><br>
      <h2>Eggs</h2>
      <img style="height: 200px;"src="eggs.jpeg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
      <p>Eggs are considered as superfoods by many as they are a great source of vitamins, proteins and minerals. The proteins present in eggs makes them good for the growing baby as it generates and repairs the cells of the fetus. Additionally, eggs have a high amount of choline in them which is essential for the development of the brain and nervous system of the unborn baby.
    </p><br>
      <h2>Sweet potatoes</h2>
      <img style="height: 200px;"src="sweet.jpeg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
      <p>Sweet potatoes are a very good source of beta-carotene, which is converted into vitamin A inside the body and it is essential for the growth of cells and tissues. Vitamin A also helps in boosting the immunity and improving the vision. So, eating more sweet potatoes can be beneficial for both mother and the unborn baby.
    </p><br>
      <h2>Legumes</h2>
      <img style="height: 200px;"src="l.jpeg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
      <p>Legumes are the group of foods which includes lentils, soybeans, peas, beans, chickpeas and peanuts. They are an excellent source of plant-based fibre, protein, folate, calcium and iron, and all of these are very important for a pregnant woman. Having enough folate will make sure that your baby will be born healthy and stay protected from many diseases and infections in future.

    </p><br>
      <h2>Orange juice</h2>
