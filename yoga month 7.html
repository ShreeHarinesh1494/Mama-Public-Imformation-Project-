      <center><h2>Benefits Of Yoga In Third Trimester(7 Month)</h2></center><br>
      <center><h3>1.Anxiety and depression</h3></center>
      <br>
      <center><p>Yoga focuses on the mind and the body connection, which helps reduce anxiety and depression in most pregnant women.</p></center>
      <br>
      <center><h3>2.Stress</h3></center><br>
      <center><p>A stress-free pregnancy can be achieved with prenatal yoga toward the later months when the hormonal levels are at a peak.</p></center>
      <br>
      <center><h3>3.Preeclampsia</h3></center><br>
      <center><p>Practicing yoga during the third trimester can help strengthen your core or pelvic region and prepare the body for birth. Prenatal yoga practice might lower the risks for pelvic dysfunction during labor.</p></center>
      <br>
      <center><h3>4.Childbirth</h3></center><br>
      <center><p>Practicing yoga during the third trimester can help strengthen your core or pelvic region and prepare the body for birth. Prenatal yoga practice might lower the risks for pelvic dysfunction during labor.</p></center>
      <br>
      <center><h2>1.SUKHASANA</h2>
        <br>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="easy-pose.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p>A common complaint of people in the third trimester is wrist pain and sensitivity, particularly at night. The wrist rolls in this pose are helpful for alleviating some of that discomfort. There is also an element of perseverance in this variation, as it requires us to keep our arms raised for longer than we might prefer, which we can use as an opportunity to practice breathing through sensation—a very important skill to have in preparation for birth.</p>
        <br>
     
        <h2>2.TABLETOP ON FOREARMS WITH HAMMOCK ROCKS</h2><br>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="arms.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p>This particular forearms and knees pose comes with a gentle hammock for your baby, which not only helps to relieve pressure off your own back, but can be soothing for your baby as you sway with your breath. Lastly, this pose can be a good alternative to child’s pose as your belly grows.

            Begin to shift your body forward on an inhale and back on an exhale, rocking your baby with the breath. Rock for 20 breaths. Then pause on elbows and knees to rest for a few breaths before moving on to the next pose.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3.UPPER BACK OPENER WITH ELBOWS ON A CHAIR</h2><br>
        <img style="height: 200px;"src="elbow.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
        <p>Many big backbends are contraindicated during pregnancy, especially later term. This is because it can place too much strain on the linea alba, the connective tissue supporting the rectus abdominis and the lower back. But the upper back often gets incredibly tight in pregnancy as our center of gravity shifts forward. This heart-opener uses a chair (or ledge or sofa) to help create space in the upper back, while keeping space for baby, and it is gentle on the wrists.</p>
        <br>
        <center><h2>4.UTKATASANA</h2>
            <br>
            <img style="height: 200px;"src="chair-pose.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
            <p>One of the goals of a third trimester practice is preparing for birth. A recent study showed birth to be as physically strenuous as running a marathon—so they don’t call it labor for nothing! Labor is not just physical, but also mental. What better place to train our body and mind than on our yoga mat. Long holds in chair pose are one way to do this</p>
            <br>
        <h2>5.UTKATA KONASANA</h2>
                <br>
                <img style="height: 200px;"src="goddess.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
                <p>A common complaint from third trimester yogis, especially as they approach full term, is pubic pain and discomfort. The pelvic bones begin to move and widen in preparation for birth, but sometimes they move asymmetrically. This can lead to pain, especially when one side of the body is doing something different than the other is, like warrior II or simply walking up stairs. Symmetrical standing poses where both sides do the same thing can be very helpful for continuing to build leg strength, without overstraining the pubic region.</p>
            
                <br>
        <h2>6.SEATED DOUBLE PIGEON VARIATION</h2>
            <br>
            <img style="height: 200px;"src="pigeon.jpg" alt="Abdominal Poses">
            <p>Hip pain and soreness are other symptoms of shifting pelvic bones and can be quite uncomfortable. Many of the go-to hip openers we know and love are not always accessible during pregnancy. This seated version of double pigeon utilizes props to help pregnant people experience deep release through their outer hips, while also accommodating their growing bellies. </p></center>
